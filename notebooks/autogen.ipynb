If open orders are larger than this, the inventory will rise (once the open orders arrive). If open orders are smaller than this, the backlog will not go down and it may even rise. Please consider the lead time and place your order in advance. Remember that your upstream has its own lead time, so do not wait until your inventory runs out. Also, avoid ordering too many units at once. Try to spread your orders over multiple rounds to prevent the bullwhip effect. Anticipate future demand changes and adjust your orders accordingly to maintain a stable inventory level.\n",
